This repository houses `profile/README.md`, whose contents get echoed into the Overview tab of our organization's profile.  We're leveraging that to deliver an FAQ covering the most common questions sent to our support team.

Important note: everything in this FAQ will be *public*!  We can't reveal something only to Outside Collaborators, and learners aren't Members, so they're going to see the same README that everyone else does.  Don't reveal any information that you'd rather somebody not have when they start the challenge.
